# Spelunky 2 Archipelago Mod
This mod allows you to connect to Archipelago in order to play a multiworld randomizer. Every journal entry is a location that you can check, and the item you send out could be anything from anyone's game, including your own. For more information about Archipelago, visit their [website](https://archipelago.gg/) or join their [Discord server](https://discord.gg/8Z65BR2).
## Features
- Multiple game options to customize your experience, such as:
    - The goal of the run
    - How worlds should be unlocked
    - Starting Health, Bombs, and Ropes
    - A variety of disruptive traps
    - Death link, where if someone dies in their game, you die as well. The reverse is also true
- Worlds must be unlocked
    - By default, you will have access to the Dwelling. To progress any further than that, you will need to find or be sent world unlocks from other people in the multiworld

## Installation Instructions
1. Follow the Archipelago setup guide [here](https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/Archipelago/setup/en)
2. Download the latest version of the Spelunky 2 apworld [here]()
3. Double click the installed apworld to automatically install it to Archipelago, or manually move the file into the custom_worlds folder in your Archipelago installation
4. Download the latest version of Modlunky 2 [here](https://github.com/spelunky-fyi/modlunky2/releases/latest), and make sure you are using the 
5. Download the latest version of the mod using Modlunky to automatically install it to your mods folder, or download the mod from this page and extract the contents of the .zip file to Mods/Packs in your Spelunky 2 installation
6. Navigate to the Playlunky tab in Modlunky 2, toggle "Archipelago" and click "Play!"
    - It is HIGHLY recommended to turn on the "Use Playlunky Save" in the options menu! This mod frequently overwrites the save used by the game, and while it does make backups, errors can occur. I cannot be held liable if you lose your save file while using this mod.
7. Once on the main menu, you will need to enable the mod manually, as it requires unsafe mode to load the library used to connect to Archipelago
8. Enter your slot name, the server address, and password (if applicable) in the popup menu and click connect to connect to Archipelago
    - If you receive a message saying "Socket Error: invalid http status", restart your game. I don't know why this happens, but restarting the game usually fixes it
9. Once you see a message saying "Slot Connected" in the top left, you are connected to Archipelago and ready to begin playing!

For any suggestions or bug reports, please join the Archipelago Discord server (linked above), navigate to the future-game-designs forum, and find the Spelunky 2 thread. I likely won't see them anyplace else.
